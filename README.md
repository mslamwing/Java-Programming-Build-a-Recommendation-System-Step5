## Java Programming：A DIY Version of Netflix And Amazon Recommendation Engines
Learn without enrollment! I searched almost the online resources and finally made it. I tried to find if there are open resources on other website. I tried to get the video and assignment link from the Coursera inspect. I tried to connect several users’ LinkedIn who uploaded their code on Github. God bless, finally, thanks for a user who uploaded all assignment instructions on his Github. I’ve already collect almost all the material and write in a pdf file and will share it here. Hope that may help you. 

### Run this project [HERE](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/capstone/recommender.php?id=doM6ILtR7zHlFA)!
### An Example of Input and Output:

The rank and rating of the recommendation are based on the raters who have similar ratings with you, which means you two may have the same preferences for movies.
The calculation is based on the weighted average from the top similar raters：

  #### The closer to your rating, the greater their rating weight
<br/>
In this way, you will receive more accurate recommendation because we've already ignored those people have different preferences that may result in bias.<br/><br/>


### More:
This is a Capstone project, which is the last Course ([Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-design-principles?specialization=java-programming)) of the <br />
[Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming) that designed by Duke University.

### Thank you Duke, I have learned a lot from this specialization. Strongly recommend to beginners.
